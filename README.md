> Deploy a dynamic Python Flask app to Google Cloud Run with traffic splitting, environment configs, and CI/CD via Cloud Build and GitHub triggers.

This guide walks through the deployment of a Flask application to **Google Cloud Run**, with **Cloud Build triggers**, **revision rollouts**, and **traffic splitting** using the `gcloud` CLI and GitHub integration.

## üß≠ Project Summary

The **gcp-cloudrun** project is a Python Flask-based web application deployed to **Google Cloud Run** using a CI/CD workflow powered by **Google Cloud Build** and **GitHub**. The application is structured around a dual-branch deployment strategy, where versioned branches (`be-a-man-level-10-v1` and `be-a-man-level-10-v2`) represent distinct revisions of the application. These revisions are built and deployed either manually via the `gcloud run deploy` CLI or automatically via GitHub-triggered Cloud Build pipelines.

The app dynamically renders content based on environment variables, which are configured at deployment time. Once deployed, revisions can be managed through **Cloud Run traffic splitting**, allowing the developer to direct specific percentages of user traffic to different versions of the service (e.g., **50/50 rollout**). This enables controlled testing, rollback, and revision monitoring without downtime. The architecture is lightweight, serverless, and regionally deployed in `asia-northeast1`, leveraging Google's managed infrastructure for scalability and security.

## üåø Repository Branches - WIP not implemented yet

The GitHub repo `https://github.com/jastek69/gcp-cloudrun-basic.git` contains two main branches:

### üîπ [`be-a-man-level-10-v1`](https://github.com/https://github.com/jastek69/gcp-cloudrun-basic.git/tree/gcp-cloudrun-v1)

- Basic Flask app  
- Default environment values  
- Cloud Run v1 deployable

### üîπ [`be-a-man-level-10-v2`](https://github.com/https://github.com/jastek69/gcp-cloudrun-basic.git/tree/gcp-cloudrun-v2)

- Enhanced content via environment vars (e.g., `"Fight Smith Til The End"`)
- Includes `cloudbuild.yaml` for automated builds  
- Ready for second Cloud Run revision and traffic split

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `source URL not found` | Use `--source=.` with a **local clone** |
| `beta command not found` | Run Google Cloud SDK Shell as Admin and install with `gcloud components install beta` |
| `no connected repo` | Use Cloud Console to connect GitHub via Cloud Build |
| `invalid revision name` | List actual revisions with `gcloud run revisions list` |
| `traffic split fails` | Ensure **2+ revisions exist**, and revision names match exactly |
